# White game project

## Description :

- Little personal side project in 2D, about combat and arena, maybe multiplayer later and will be using enemy AI when the player don't want to play online.
The project name comes from the fact that the game will be mostly white with colors on interaction to attract the eyes.

## Why this project ?

- I need to train to be able to get a job.

## Release date ?

- I don't know when it will be yet, I'm doing this aside from work, so it may take longer than expected, but if I need to give a release date, it would be around January 2024 (Always expect it to take longer than the given date).
